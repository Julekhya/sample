Unit converter project works from the steps user interface,input handling,conversion logic,calculation to finally ouput

User Interface: The project starts with a user interface where the user can input the value they want to convert and select the units they are converting from and to. This interface can be implemented as a command-line interface or any other depending on the application.

Input Handling: Once the user enters the value and selects the units, the program parses this input and validates it to ensure it's in the correct format.

Conversion Logic: The program then performs the actual conversion using conversion factors. These factors are predetermined constants that relate one unit of measurement to another.

Calculation: The program multiplies the input value by the appropriate conversion factor to obtain the converted value.

Output: Finally, the program displays the converted value to the user.

Optional Features: Advanced unit converter projects might include additional features such as support for a wide range of units, the ability to add custom units, handling of different data types (e.g., length, weight, temperature), and support for complex conversions involving multiple steps.
